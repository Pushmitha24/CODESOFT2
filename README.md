Task 2: Exploring Machine Learning: Classifying Iris Flowers with Python

In this we can see how machine learning algorithms can be applied to real-world datasets. 📈 

Let's dive into a classic example – the Iris flower dataset. 🌺 



It comprises measurements of Iris flowers categorized into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. In this our task is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. 📝 



Overview of the process:

Data Preparation: We load the Iris dataset using Python's scikit-learn library and convert it into a pandas DataFrame. This step makes data manipulation and analysis more manageable.

Model Selection and Training: For this task, we opt for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel.  We train the model using the training data.

Model Evaluation: After training the model, we evaluate its performance using the test dataset. We calculate accuracy of the model.

Conclusion : Our model achieves a certain level of accuracy in classifying Iris flowers into their respective species. 

This example highlights the foundational steps of building a machine learning model using the Iris dataset.
